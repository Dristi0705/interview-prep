# Given a string s, return the longest palindromic subtring in s
#
# Example 1:
# Input: s = "babad"
# Output: "bab"
# Explanation: "aba" is also a valid answer.
#
# Example 2:
# Input: s = "cbbd"
# Output: "bb"
#
# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= s.length <= 1000
# s consist of only digits and English letters.
